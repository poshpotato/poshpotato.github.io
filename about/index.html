    <p> Hi! This site is my personal testing ground for a game I'm making, which's in testing title is <a href="../Potato Palace/index.html">Potato Palace.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>Eventually, I hope to make it into a idle-style magic game in which you experiment with magic yourself. In addition, I have plans for a Zero-player fantasy game akin to dungeons and dragons.</p>
